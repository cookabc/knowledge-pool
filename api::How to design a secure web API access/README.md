## [How to design a secure web API access for you website?](https://twitter.com/alexxubyte/status/1514256018187816965)

> When we open web API access to users, we need to make sure each API call is authenticated. This means the user must be who they claim to be.
> 
> There are two common ways:
> 1. Token based authentication
> 2. HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) authentication
> 
> The diagram below illustrates how they work.

### Token based
1. Step 1 - the user enters their password into the client, and the client sends the password to the Authentication Server.
2. Step 2 - the Authentication Server authenticates the credentials and generates a token with an expiry time.
3. Steps 3 and 4 - now the client can send requests to access server resources with the token in the HTTP header. This access is valid until the token expires.

### HMAC based
> This mechanism generates a Message Authentication Code (signature) by using a hash function (SHA256 or MD5).

1. Steps 1 and 2 - the server generates two keys, one is Public APP ID (public key) and the other one is API Key (private key).
2. Step 3 - we now generate a HMAC signature on the client side (hmac A). This signature is generated with a set of attributes listed in the diagram.
3. Step 4 - the client sends requests to access server resources with hmac A in the HTTP header.
4. Step 5 - the server receives the request which contains the request data and the authentication header. It extracts the necessary attributes from the request and uses the API key thatâ€™s stored on the server side to generate a signature (hmac B.)
5. Steps 6 and 7 - the server compares hmac A (generated on the client side) and hmac B (generated on the server side). If they are matched, the requested resource will be returned to the client.

## [The Code Review Pyramid](https://www.morling.dev/blog/the-code-review-pyramid/)

> When it comes to code reviews, itâ€™s a common phenomenon that there is much focus and long-winded discussions about mundane aspects like code formatting and style, whereas important aspects (does the code change do what it is supposed to do, is it performant, is it backwards-compatible for existing clients, and many others) tend to get less attention.
